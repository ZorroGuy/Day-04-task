This repository contains implementations of various JavaScript functions and algorithms. Each function or algorithm is categorized based on its functionality and implemented using different programming paradigms such as anonymous functions, Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE), and arrow functions.

Implementation Categories:
Anonymous Functions: Functions implemented using the traditional anonymous function syntax.
IIFE: Functions implemented using Immediately Invoked Function Expressions, providing encapsulation and immediate execution.
Arrow Functions: Functions implemented using the concise arrow function syntax introduced in ECMAScript 6.
Included Programs:
Printing odd numbers in an array
Converting strings to title caps in a string array
Calculating the sum of all numbers in an array
Returning all prime numbers in an array
Returning all palindromes in an array
